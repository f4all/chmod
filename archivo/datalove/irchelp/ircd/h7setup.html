networks. This guide is part of our <a href="index.html">ircd help
section</a>, and is intended for the
relative novice. Before you attempt to set up your own ircd, you should be
reasonably expert at both the IRC protocol and UNIX. For example, have you set
up IRC clients on UNIX before (not one of those auto-install deals, but rather
downloading, uncompressing, configuring, compiling, and installing it the old
fashioned way)? That would be a minimal test of your experience. I would also
suggest you first look over the <a href="server-request.html">Server Request FAQ</a> to
make sure you really want to do this. -Jolo</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome. This document is to help with the configuration, compiling, and basic
use of Hybrid 7. This guide is the first one I have written, so it most likely
wont be the best, but I will try to do my best :).</p>

<p>The following task is not going to be an easy one. This can consume hours of
your time. Make sure you are committed to this when you start it, as it may be
difficult to pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>Side note, while you <em>CAN</em> run an irc server off of a connection as low as a
56k, however, it is not a good idea. if you are doing it for personal reasons,
cable is probably ideal. For public applications, such as linking to the
popular networks, you will most likely have to have a minimum of a t3
connection to be accepted.</p>

<p>*The author has successfully compiled Hybrid 7 beta on FreeBSD, Linux Mandrake 7.2, various versions of Solaris, and versions of Redhat. </p>

<p><em>The default directory is /usr/local/ircd/</em> </p>

<p>Lets get started!</p>

<h2>2. Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>UNIX or compatible operating system </li>
<li>tar application to unpack the source code </li>
<li>latest version of Autoconf </li>
<li>latest version of GCC </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Obtaining the latest release</h2>

<p>You can get the latest version of h7 from the <a href="http://www.ircdhelp.org/ircdvers.html">IRCdhelp.org ircd
archive</a>.</p>

<p>[As of the creation of this guide, the latest version is ircd-hybrid-
7beta1.tgz]</p>

<h2>4. Attention</h2>

<p>Before we go any further:</p>

<p>As a matter of principle, if something can run as a non-root user, it should
do so. Running daemons as root risks much higher damage in the event of a
security breach. If ircd is one day shown to have an exploitable bug that
yields ircd user privilages and the ircd user is root, you may find yourself
in dire straits indeed. Ircd will work just fine without root privileges. So
create an ircd user before you do anything and su(1) to it for the
installation.</p>

<h2>5. Unpacking the source</h2>

<p>The source package comes in a gzip&#8217;ed tar file (.tar.gz). Copy the file to a
directory you wish to install the Hybrid 7 source under. To unpack it use the
following command: tar -zxf filename If your system&#8217;s tar program does not
support the -z flag gunzip (or gzip -d) it first and then &#8216;tar -xf filename&#8217;,
or, tar -xvf &lt;/path/filename>.</p>

<h2>6. Editing the ircd source to meet your needs</h2>

<p>Before we get started, you can damage the source code and your compile may
fail if you tamper with any of the files that aren&#8217;t mentioned here. unless
you <em>ABSOLUTELY</em> <em>POSITIVELY</em> know what you are doing, don&#8217;t mess with them!</p>

<p>The files we will cover in this section:</p>

<ul>
<li>/<path to source>/include/config.h - Compile time configuration </li>
<li>/<path to source>/messages/custom.po - Server messages file </li>
</ul>

<h3>A. /<path to source>/include/config.h customization walkthrough</h3>

<p><em>Above every section in config.h is a farily detailed description on what that particular statement will do if #define&#8217;d or #undef&#8217;d</em> </p>

<p>The first thing to do: Edit directory and file locations to suit your needs,
if you dont know anything about it, or want it to install to its default
locations, Leave them be. The things you may want to edit go as follows: DPATH
= root directory of installation</p>

<p>MODPATH = path to module directory</p>

<p>MSGPATH = path of directory containing a message (.mo) file</p>

<p>SPATH = the server executeable</p>

<p>CPATH = the conf (configuration) file</p>

<p>KPATH = kline conf file</p>

<p>DLPATH = dline conf file</p>

<p>RPATH = RSA keyfile</p>

<p>MPATH = motd file</p>

<p>PPATH = pid file</p>

<p>HPATH = oper help file (displayed through /quote help)</p>

<p>OPATH = path to the MOTD for opers</p>

<p>Examples of the paths:</p>

<pre><code>#define DPATH   IRCD_PREFIX *leave blank for default path*
#define MODPATH IRCD_PREFIX "/modules/autoload/"
#define MSGPATH IRCD_PREFIX "/messages/"
#define SPATH   IRCD_PREFIX "/bin/ircd"
#define CPATH   ETCPATH "/ircd.conf"
#define KPATH   ETCPATH "/kline.conf"
#define DLPATH  ETCPATH "/kline.conf"
#define RPATH   ETCPATH "/ircd.rsa"
#define MPATH   ETCPATH "/ircd.motd"
#define PPATH   ETCPATH "/ircd.pid"
#define HPATH   ETCPATH "/opers.txt"
#define OPATH   ETCPATH "/opers.motd"
</code></pre>

<p>The below portion is for the basic configuration of config.h to get you going
faster. Change nothing unless it is specified below if you&#8217;re new at this.</p>

<p>You may want to increase the TS delta if you&#8217;re linking a server that does not
always have the precise time. Rather than breaking TS though, you should synch
your local time with a time server using ntpdate(8) or similar program and
leave the TS delta be. If you get TS delta errors while linking servers, synch
the time on both systems via NTP. Clock drift can be significant, you should
automate the procedure to perform at least on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Unless your going to run your server on EFnet, change NETWORK<em>NAME</em>DEFAULT and
NETWORK<em>DESC</em>DEFAULT to reflect your network information.</p>

<p>CRYPT<em>OPER</em>PASSWORD:</p>

<p>This is something you&#8217;re better off doing if the ircd is running on a machine
to which untrusted third parties, such as shell users, have access. Generate
encrypted passwords using the mkpasswd utility which is built in as part of
the ircd package.</p>

<p>To enable encryption:</p>

<h1>define CRYPT<em>OPER</em>PASSWORD</h1>

<h1>define CRYPT<em>LINK</em>PASSWORD * i think that both servers participating server</h1>

<p>need matching CRYPT<em>LINK</em>PASSWORD lines. If the server your goint to link to
has it #undef&#8217;d, #undef it, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>To disable encryption:</p>

<h1>undef CRYPT<em>OPER</em>PASSWORD</h1>

<h1>undef CRYPT<em>LINK</em>PASSWORD</h1>

<p>To change the number of channels that a user is allowed to be on at a time is
determined by #define MAXCHANNELSPERUSER x (where x is, put a number from, ill
say 1 to 30 - the default, and recomended value is 15) [The smaller your
bandwith, the lower the number should be i guess]</p>

<h3>B. /<path to source>/messages/custom.po</h3>

<p>Edit this file if you want the server to display your own messages.</p>

<h2>7. Compiling and making the server</h2>

<p>Well, now that you&#8217;ve conquered at least the basic configuration of config.h
and custom.po (optionally), you&#8217;re ready to configure and compile the server.</p>

<p>To configure: cd to /<path to source></p>

<p>./configure &#8212;prefix=&#8221;/path/to/install/to&#8221;</p>

<p>(if you want to compile to the default directory, just do ./configure)</p>

<p>As soon as its done, and assuming it completed successfully, type, make -If it
did not complete successfully, obtain the proper things, and try it again!</p>

<p>@ Things? What things?</p>

<p>If the make procedure was successful, lastly, type make install -If make
failed, do whats described above about unsuccessful ./configure</p>

<h2>8. Editing your ircd.conf file</h2>

<p>Now, you will want to cd to /<install path>/etc/ and then edit example.conf.</p>

<p>For a quick config, follow this guide:</p>

<p>Edit the serverinfo block to roughly look like the below:</p>

<pre><code>(serverinfo replaces the old M: line)
serverinfo {
    name="&lt;server name&gt;";
    description="&lt;server description&gt;";
    #The network_name and network_desc variables override
    #the compiled in defaults.  These are used for server
    #hiding.
    network_name="-";
    network_desc="-";
    # HUB is no longer a compiled in option.  It is set at 
    # runtime in this block and changable with a REHASH
    hub=yes;
    # vhost defines what IP to bind to for *OUTGOING* connections.
    # This replaces the old M: line IP, and is only needed for 
    # multi-homed or virtual hosted machines not using the default
    # IP.  Note that you *MUST* use the IP, not a hostname, and it
    # cannot be in quotes
    # vhost=192.169.0.1;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now to edit the Admin block:</p>

<pre><code>admin {
    name="&lt;primary server administrator's name&gt;";
    email="&lt;email@address&gt;";
    description="&lt;server admin description&gt;";
};
</code></pre>

<p>Leave everything be until you get to the listen block.</p>

<pre><code>listen {
    # accepts hostnames as well as ips
    # ip="192.168.0.1";
    port=&lt;listen for connection requests from this port (commonly 6667)&gt;;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Dont bother modifying anything from the listen block to the operator block:</p>

<pre><code>operator {
    # The nick of the oper
    name="&lt;the nickname of the desired oper&gt;";
    # user@host, note that CIDR in O: lines is not *CURRENTLY* 
    # supported (an important note for Hybrid 6 users)
    user="*&lt;identd username&gt;@*&lt;hostmask&gt;";
    # The encrypted password used in the OPER command
    # Note:  if you #undef CRYPT_OPER_PASSWORD in config.h, you must
    #        use the plaintext password here.  MD5 passwords are 
    #        supported and available on some platforms (FreeBSD 4.x
    #        and Linux glibc are known to work)
    # password="$1$tPH$nN7t5Jj14wYCoDZXc4fe91";
    # password="etcnjl8juSU1E"
    password="&lt;password&gt;";

<p>Add a dline or 2, or, dont:</p>

<p>Even more blocking, again, touch, or don&#8217;t:</p>

<p>Now save the file as /<install path>/etc/ircd.conf Congratulations.. Your done
editing the configuration file!</p>

<h2>9. Testing your server</h2>

<p>After you have completed all the steps described in sections 6 and 7 you will
want to cd to /<install path>/bin/ and type ./ircd to get your server going.
Now open your irc client of choice and connect to your ip, hostname, domain
name, whatever&#8230; if all connects smoothly, type /oper <nickname set in
operator block name="";> <password set in operator block password="";></p>

<p>If you gain ircoppage, consider your ircd a working one. Last step to testing
your server, invite some friends, if they can join and make channels and chat,
and list channels, etc., your server is a-ok.</p>

<h2>10. Commands</h2>

<p>Essential Commands: (This may not have every command in the world, as i do not
have a list, and may not remember them all.. You may want to check
<a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">www.irchelp.org</a> for a complete list)</p>

<p>Ed. note: In particular, you should check out the <a href="ircopguide.html">IRC Operator
Guide</a>.</p>

<pre><code>die (server name) = Shuts down the server [Operators]
cjoin (channel name) = "Clones" a channel (creates a v-chan) [Everyone]
rehash (parameter) = Rehashes the specified file. using /rehash by itself 
            rehashes ircd.conf [Operators]
connect (server specified in a connect block) = Connects your server to 
            the one you specify [Operators]
kill (nickname) (reason) = kills the client behind (nickname) for (reason) 
            [Operators]
wallop (text) = broadcasts (text) all over the network to 
    operators and people who have wallop viewing enabled in there 
    irc client [Operators]
stats (parameter) = gives you status of (parameter) - different parameters 
    include:  [Everyone(Standard users can use some, others, Opers only)]
        ? - Server connection stats
        c - connection blocks
        i - i-lines
        h - h-lines
        l - l-lines
        k - k-lines
        x - gecos blocks
        y - y-lines
        z - more server stats
restart (server name) = resets _ALL_ connections to the server. [Operators]
squit (server) :(reason) = disconnects (server) from the network. [Operators]
</code></pre>

<h2>11. Automation</h2>

<p>If you want to make your server start automatically, a basic way to do it is
to make a crontab that points to a perl script that checks if the server is
running and starts it if it isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The crontab:</p>

<pre><code>0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50 * * * *    perl /&lt;path to below script&gt;/&lt;script&gt;.pl
</code></pre>

<p>The script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl &lt;- edit if necessary to reflect your perl location

#This is a simple script to check the status of ircd, and start it if 
#necessary
#By NoizyToyz, with help from Vamps.

#Edit to reflect your proper paths and filenames:
system('/&lt;install path&gt;/bin/ircd') if ( ! `ps -aef|grep -v grep|grep ircd`);
</code></pre>
