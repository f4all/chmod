<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>Have you ever wanted to talk with other computer users in other parts of the
world? Well guess what? You can! The program is called IRC, (Internet Relay
Chat), and it is networked over much of North America, Asia Europe, and
Oceania. This program is a substitute for &#8216;talk&#8217;, and many other multiple talk
programs you might have read about. When you are talking on IRC, everything
you type will instantly be transmitted around the world to other users that
might be watching their terminals at the time. They can then type something
and respond to your messages, and vice versa. I should warn you that the
program can be very addictive once you begin to make friends and contacts on
IRC, especially when you learn how to talk in 14 languages.</p>

<p>Topics of discussion on IRC are varied, just like the topics of Usenet
newsgroups are varied. Technical and political discussions are popular,
especially when world events are in progress. IRC is also a way to expand your
horizons, as people from many countries and cultures are on 24 hours a day.
Most conversations are in English, but there are always channels in German,
Japanese, French, Finnish, and occasionally other languages.</p>

<p>IRC gained international fame during the late Persian Gulf War, when updates
from around the world came across the wire, and most people on IRC gathered on
a single channel to hear these reports.</p>

<h1>1. Getting Started</h1>

<h3>1.1 Clients and Servers</h3>

<p>IRC (original code was written by Jarkko Oikarinen) is a multi-user, multi-
channel chatting network. It allows people all over the internet to talk to
one another in real-time. It is a functional replacement and improvement to
&#8216;talk&#8217;; &#8216;talk&#8217; is an old, primitive, atrocious, minimalist sort of
keyboard/screen conversation tool, using a grotesque, machine- dependent
protocol (blah!). IRC does everything &#8216;talk&#8217; does, but with better protocol,
allowing more than 2 users to talk at once, with access across the aggregate
Internet, and providing a whole raft of other useful features.</p>

<p>There are two ways to enter IRC from a Unix system. If you are using the emacs
(editor from Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation) lisp client,
you just have to type &#8220;M-x irc&#8221;, (if this doesn&#8217;t work you may need to load
the client into your emacs session). If you are using the C client, (easier
for beginners), then you usually type &#8220;irc&#8221;. Non-Unix boxes have special
clients, each of which has to be configured using a special procedure. Check
the manual or help screen for more information.</p>

<p>If you wish to be known by a nickname which is not your login name, type &#8220;irc
nickname&#8221; instead. Each IRC user, (&#8220;client&#8221;), chooses a nickname. All
communication with another user is either by nickname or by the channel that
they or you are on (more information about channels later on).</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember about IRC is that you have to be willing
to explore and learn to use it. Take your time, try not to get flustered,
enjoy yourself, and you will soon be making new friends all over the world!</p>

<p>IRC is based on a client-server model. Clients are programs that connect to a
server, a server is a program that transports data, (messages), from a user
client to another. There are clients running on many different systems, (Unix,
emacs, VMS, MSDOS, VM&#8230;), that allow you to connect to an IRC server. The
client which will be spoken of here is the most widespread: ircII, (originally
designed by Michael Sandrof). Other clients are similar, and often accept
ircII commands.</p>

<h3>1.2 How to behave on IRC</h3>

<p>The most widely understood and spoken language on IRC is English. However, as
IRC is used in many different countries, English is by no means the only
language. If you want to speak some other language than English, (for example
with your friends), go to a separate channel and set the topic to indicate
that. On the other hand, you should check the topic before you move to a
channel to see if there are any restrictions about language. On a non-
restricted channel, please speak a language everybody can understand. If you
want to do otherwise, change channels and set the topic accordingly.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not necessary to greet everybody on a channel personally. Usually one
&#8220;Hello!&#8221; or equivalent is enough. And don&#8217;t expect everybody to greet you
back. On a channel with 20 people that would mean one screenful of hellos.
It&#8217;s sensible not to greet, in order not to be rude to the rest of the
channel. If you must say hello to somebody you know, do it with a private
message. The same applies to goodbyes.</p>

<p>Also note that using your client facilities, (ircII &#8220;ON&#8221; command, for
instance), to automatically say hello or goodbye to people is extremely poor
etiquette. Nobody wants to receive auto-greets. They are not only obviously
automatic, but even if you think you are polite, you are actually sounding
insincere and also interfering with the personal environment of the recipient.
If somebody wants to be auto-greeted on joining a channel, he will auto-greet
himself.</p>

<p>Remember, people on IRC form their opinions about you only by your actions,
writings and comments, so think before you type. If you use offensive words,
you&#8217;ll be frowned upon. Do not &#8220;dump&#8221; to a channel or user, (send large
amounts of unwanted information). This is likely to get you kicked off the
channel or killed off from IRC. Dumping causes network &#8220;burps&#8221;, connections
going down because servers cannot handle the large amount of traffic anymore.
Other prohibited actions include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Harassing another user. Harassment is defined as behavior towards another user with the purpose of annoying them.</p></li>
<li><p>Annoying a channel with constant beeping.</p></li>
<li><p>Any behavior reducing the functionality of IRC.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Privacy on IRC</h3>

<p>You should always keep in mind that messages you send to someone over IRC are
passed along all the servers between you and and the person you are writing
to. When you&#8217;re sending a letter to someone, any postman on the way could open
it and read its contents.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s the same on the network. Any IRC-Admin could compile their server
in &#8220;debug&#8221; mode and log whatever messages are transmitted through his node,
(it has already been done), so a good rule of thumb is not to trust the
servers.</p>

<p>**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IRC IS NOT A SECURE WAY OF COMMUNICATION!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**</p>

<p>How to establish direct communications between clients will be explained
later, (see DCC CHAT in section 2.5). This should be used when you wouldn&#8217;t
want anybody else on IRC to intercept your private messages.</p>

<p>[ table of contents | navigation bar ]</p>

<hr />

<h3>1.4 First Steps</h3>

<p>Note: ircII, the client most people are using, has most of this information
online. If you are stuck, type &#8220;/HELP&#8221; and hit . To escape from HELP mode,
keep pressing  until your edit line, (the line at the bottom of the screen),
is empty. Most of the information in this file can be found typing these
commands: &#8220;/HELP INTRO&#8221; or &#8220;/HELP NEWUSER&#8221;.</p>

<p>**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All ircII commands begin with a &#8220;/irchelp/&#8221; character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**</p>

<p>The slash is the default command character. Commands are not case sensitive,
and can be abbreviated to their first letters: &#8220;/SI&#8221; and &#8220;/sign &#8221; stand for
/SIGNOFF and will both end your IRC session, (more in section 2.1).</p>

<p>Anything that does not begin with &#8220;/irchelp/&#8221; is assumed to be a message to
someone and will be sent to your current channel, or to a person you are
QUERYing, (the QUERY command will be detailed later on, maybe in section 2.2).</p>

<p>If you are not sure about the spelling of an ircII command, type the prefix of
that command, and press the ESCape key twice; ircII will give you a listing of
commands and aliases that start with that prefix. Don&#8217;t forget the &#8220;/irchelp/&#8221;
in front of the command though.</p>

<pre><code>        /W &lt;ESC&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;
        *** Commands:
        ***     WAIT            WALL            WALLOPS         WHICH
        ***     WHILE           WHO             WHOIS           WHOWAS
        ***     WINDOW
        *** Aliases:
        ***     W
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example. Your screen may show more aliases, and less commands than
shown here, or less aliases and more commands - in other words &#8220;your mileage
may vary.&#8221;</p>

<h3>1.5 Screen and Keyboard activity</h3>

<p>IRC is a full-screen utility. It takes over the screen, with the bulk of
activity happening in the top (N-2) lines, a status line, (vaguely emacs-
like), on the next to last line, and your input being entered on the last
line. When typing commands at ircII, you have a minimalist line-editing
facility in an emacs style.</p>

<pre><code>        Table 1:  Editing keys
        ----------------------
           Key      Effects
           ~~~      ~~~~~~~
            ^P      recalls previous command line
            ^N      recalls next command line
            ^F      moves forward one character
            ^B      moves backward one character
            ^A      moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
            ^E      moves the cursor to the end of the line
            ^D      deletes the character under the cursor
            ^K      kills from the cursor to the end
            ^Y      reinserts the last stretch of killed text
            ^U      clears the whole line
            ^L      redraws the screen



        Table 2:  Editing commands
        --------------------------
           Keyword   Action
           ~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~
           !         recalls previous commands for re-editing
           HISTORY   displays the command history
           LASTLOG   lists the most recent messages
           CLEAR     puts some white space on your screen
</code></pre>

<p>The ! command is used to recall previous commands in your command history for
re-execution. The ! command is unique in that when it is used, it leaves the
matching history entry in the input line for re-editing. You can specify a
history entry either by its number in the history list, or by a match with a
given wildcard expression. For instance, &#8220;/!10&#8221; will put entry 10 in the
history list into the input line. &#8220;/!/MSG&#8221; will search the history for a line
beginning with a /MSG, (a &#8220;*&#8221; is implied at the end).</p>

<p><strong>/!</strong> [<history number>|<history match>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recalls previous commands for re-editing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>/HISTORY</strong> [<number>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Displays the command history on the screen. You can specify the number of
  history entries you wish to view as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost everything happens in the upper bulk of the screen. This includes both
messages from other users, as well as the output of the control commands.
Normal messages from other users appear with the originating nickname in
<angle brackets>. Private messages arrive with the originating nickname in
<em>asterisks</em>. Messages you send to everyone appear with a preceding &#8220;> &#8221;
whereas messages you send privately to another user appear with &#8220;->
<em>nickname</em>&#8221;. Other output (invitations from other users to join channels, and
so forth), appears interspersed with other activity on the screen.</p>

<pre><code>                    Table 3:  Simple screen activity
                    --------------------------------

  What is displayed    What you typed      Sender     Recipients

  *some1else* wassup?                      some1else  You (only)
</code></pre>

<p>Last ircII outputs can be recalled with:</p>

<p><strong>/LASTLOG</strong> [<number of entries>|<text> [<from entry>]]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Displays the contents of the lastlog. This is a list of the most recent
  messages that have appeared on the screen, useful if you inadvertantly miss
  messages. If no arguments are given, the entire lastlog is displayed. If the
  first argument is a number, it determines how many log entries to show.
  Otherwise it is searched for in every lastlog entry. The second argument
  determines how many lines back to start display from.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /LASTLOG
        &gt; Public message I send to all in the channel
        &lt;some1else&gt; Public message from some1else
        *some1else* Private message sent to me by some1else
        -&gt; *some1else* Private message I send to some1else
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if your screen gets garbage from a &#8216;talk&#8217;, &#8216;write&#8217;, &#8216;wall&#8217; or any
other form of primitive communication (smirk), hit ^L to redraw it, or CLEAR
it.</p>

<p><strong>/CLEAR</strong>  </p>

<h3>2.1 General Commands</h3>

<pre><code>               Table 4:  General commands
                       --------------------------
    Keyword   Action
    ~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~
    NICK      changes your nickname
    QUIT      exits your IRC session, (same as BYE, SIGNOFF and EXIT)
    HELP      prints help on the given command
    WHOIS     displays information about someone
    WHOWAS    displays information about someone who just left
    AWAY      leaves a message saying you're not paying attention
</code></pre>

<p><strong>/NICK</strong> [<nickname>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes your nickname to whatever you like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone who wants to talk to you sees this name - also, at the moment,
nicknames are limited to 9 characters max. Your nickname will be the same as
your login name by default. You can also set an environment variable, IRCNICK,
the value of which will be used instead. Nickname clashes are not allowed;
this is enforced by the servers. If your intended nickname clashes with
someone else&#8217;s as you enter IRC, you will not be able to enter until you
change it to something else.</p>

<pre><code>        /NICK Nappy
        *** Nap is now known as Nappy
</code></pre>

<p><strong>/QUIT</strong> [<reason>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exits your IRC session. You can also use BYE, SIGNOFF and EXIT. If a reason
  is supplied, it is displayed to other people on your channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /QUIT Lunch Time!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>/HELP</strong> [<command>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shows help on the given command. Note: This is not installed for all
  clients, which can be kind of annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /HELP HELP
        Usage: HELP [command]
           Shows help on the given command. The help documentation is set
           up in a  hierarchical fashion.  That  means that  certain help
           topics have sub-topics under them.
        [boring stuff deleted]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>/WHOIS</strong> [<nickname>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shows information about someone.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /WHOIS Nap
        *** Nap is pioch@poly.polytechnique.fr (Klein bottle for sale...
           inquire within.)
        *** on channels: @#Twilight_Zone @#EU-Opers
        *** on via server poly.polytechnique.fr (Ecole Polytechnique,
          Paris, FRANCE ! )
        *** Nap has a connection to the twilight zone (is an IRC operator)
        *** Nap has been idle 0 seconds

        /WHOIS Nappy
        *** Nappy: No such nickname
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes WHOIS won&#8217;t help you much, because the person you want to know more
about just left IRC or changed nick. However, you can use WHOWAS to get this
information for a while:</p>

<p><strong>/WHOWAS</strong> [<server>] [<nickname>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shows information about who used the given nickname last, even if no one is
  currently using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /WHOWAS Nappy
        *** Nappy was pioch@poly.polytechnique.fr (Artistic ventures
          highlighted. Rob a museum.) on channel *private*
        *** on irc via server poly.polytechnique.fr (Signoff: Mon Jun 22
          20:15:23)
</code></pre>

<p>Very often, an unsuccessful call to WHOIS will lead you to try WHOWAS. That&#8217;s
why ircII allows you to &#8220;/SET AUTO<em>WHOWAS ON&#8221;; that way, a &#8220;*** <nickname>: No
such nickname&#8221; message will auto-magically generate a &#8220;/WHOWAS <nickname>&#8221;.
Try typing &#8220;/HELP SET AUTO</em>WHOWAS&#8221; for more information on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>/AWAY</strong> [<away message>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leave a message explaining that you are not currently paying attention to
  IRC. Whenever someone sends you a MSG or does a WHOIS on you, they
  automatically see whatever message you set. Using AWAY with no parameters
  marks you as no longer being away.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /AWAY Gone to get a cup of coffee.
        *** You have been marked as being away

        /AWAY
        *** You are no longer marked as being away

<h3>2.2 Communication and Private Conversation</h3>

<pre><code>                 Table 5: Private conversation commands
                 --------------------------------------
      Keyword  Action
      ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~
      MSG      sends a private message
      QUERY    starts a private conversation
      NOTICE   sends a private message
      NOTIFY   warns you of people logging in or out IRC
      IGNORE   removes output from specific people off your screen
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the MSG command, (usually &#8220;M&#8221; is an alias for it), to send someone
a message that only that person can read.</p>

<p><strong>/MSG</strong> <nickname>|<channel> <text>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Send a private message to specified nickname.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /MSG Nap This message is for Nap only.
        -&gt; *Nap* This message is for Nap only.

        On my screen will appear:

        *YourNick* This message is for Nap only.
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to send a private message to more than one person, you can specify
a list of nicknames separated by commas, (no spaces).</p>

<pre><code>        /MSG Nap,Sorg This message for both Nap and Sorg.
        -&gt; *Nap* This message for both Nap and Sorg.
        -&gt; *Sorg* This message for both Nap and Sorg.
</code></pre>

<p>Two special case nicknames are defined. If the nickname is &#8220;,&#8221; (a comma), the
message is sent to the last person who sent you a MSG. If the nickname is &#8220;.&#8221;
(a period), the message is sent to the last person to whom you sent a message.</p>

<p>You can have a private conversation by only using /MSG. However, typing &#8220;/MSG
<nick> <text>&#8221; or &#8220;/MSG . <text>&#8221; gets cumbersome. That&#8217;s where the /QUERY
command comes in handy.</p>

<p><strong>/QUERY</strong> [<nickname>|<channel>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starts a private conversation with <nickname>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All text you type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to the
supplied nickname in the form of MSGs. To cancel a private conversation, use
QUERY with no arguments.</p>

<pre><code>        /QUERY Nap
        *** Starting conversation with Nap

        Blahblahblah
        -&gt; *Nap* Blahblahblah

        /QUERY
        *** Ending conversation with Nap
</code></pre>

<p>There is also another command to send messages, called NOTICE. Unlike MSGs,
NOTICEs are surrounded by &#8216;-&#8217; when printed, and no automated responses, (such
as generated by IGNORE or an automaton), will be sent in reply. Services,
(robots), on IRC often use this form of interaction.</p>

<p><strong>/NOTICE</strong> <nickname>|<channel> <text>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sends a private message to the specified <nickname>.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /NOTICE Nap Better use /MSG instead of /NOTICE.
        -&gt; -Nap- Better use /MSG instead of /NOTICE.

        On my screen will appear:

        -YourNick- Better use /MSG instead of /NOTICE.
</code></pre>

<p>As you begin to make new friends over IRC, you&#8217;ll want to mark certain
nicknames such that you will be warned when they signon or off.</p>

<p><strong>/NOTIFY</strong> [[-]<nickname>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adds or removes  to the list of people you&#8217;ll be warned when they enter or
  quit IRC (in ircII versions prior to 2.2, too many people in the NOTIFY list
  cause excessive slowness).</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /NOTIFY Nap Nappy
        *** Signon by Nap detected

        /NOTIFY
        *** Currently present: Nap
        *** Currently absent: Nappy
</code></pre>

<p>Eventually, you may wish some day not to see messages from a specific user on
your screen. This may happen when someone is dumping large amounts of garbage,
or if someone is harassing you. The proper response to such a behavior is to
IGNORE that person. IGNORE is a very powerful command, and can be used in many
ways. However the basic usage of this tool is the following.</p>

<p><strong>/IGNORE</strong> [<nickname>|&lt;user@host> [[-]<message type>]]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppresses output from the given people from your screen. IGNORE can be set
  by nickname or by specifying a userid@hostname format. Wildcards may be used
  in all formats. Output that can be ignored includes MSGs, NOTICEs, PUBLIC
  messages, INVITEs, ALL or NONE. Preceding a type with a &#8220;-&#8221; indicates removal
  of ignoring of that type of message.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /IGNORE *@cheshire.oxy.edu ALL
        *** Ignoring ALL messages from *@CHESHIRE.OXY.EDU

        /IGNORE
        *** Ignorance list:
        ***     *@CHESHIRE.OXY.EDU      ALL

        /IGNORE *@cheshire.oxy.edu NONE
        *** *@cheshire.oxy.edu removed from ignorance list

<h3>2.3 Channels and Public Conversations</h3>

<p>On IRC, there are a lot of places where you can &#8220;hang out&#8221;; those places are
called &#8216;channels&#8217;, (most of the information in this section can also be
obtained by issuing &#8220;/HELP CHANNEL&#8221;). You can compare conversations on a
channel to a conversation among a group of people: you see/hear everything
that is said, and you can reply to anything that&#8217;s said. What you type is
received by everyone who&#8217;s willing to listen - and everyone who is late will
not hear what was said before, unless repeated by one of the ones who were
there. (Who said &#8220;real life&#8221; ?)</p>

<p>All channels on IRC have names: a &#8220;#&#8221; sign followed by some kind of text-
string, like &#8220;#C++&#8221; or &#8220;#Asians&#8221; or &#8220;#EU-Opers&#8221;. Usually, the name of the
channel will indicate the type of conversation that&#8217;s going on in there. Don&#8217;t
count on it, though.</p>

<pre><code>                       Table 6:  Channel commands
                       --------------------------
       Keyword   Action
       ~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~
       LIST      lists channels, number of users, topic
       NAMES     shows the nicknames of the users on each channel
       JOIN      sets your current channel, (same as CHANNEL)
       WHO       gives a listing of users
       INVITE    sends an invitation to another user
       LEAVE     leaves a channel, (same as PART)
       KICK      gets rid of someone on a channel
       TOPIC     changes the topic of the channel
       ME        sends anything about you to a channel or QUERY
       DESCRIBE  sends anything about you to a person or channel
</code></pre>

<p>Every channel has certain characteristics, called channel modes. These will
also be explained below. Remember the NAMES and LIST commands; they will show
you the names of the existing channels.</p>

<p><strong>/LIST</strong> [[<flags>] <channel mask>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lists all current &#8220;channels&#8221;, number of users, and topic. The displayed list
  may be quite long, so you can limit it using flags. &#8220;/LIST -MIN n&#8221; for
  instance removes channels with less than &#8216;n&#8217; users of the output.</p>

  Remember to filter them with &#8220;-MIN n&#8221; or &#8220;-MAX n&#8221;).</p>

<p>To join in the conversation on a certain channel you may use the JOIN command.</p>

<p><strong>/JOIN</strong> [<channel>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sets your current channel to the supplied channel.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /JOIN #Twilight_Zone
        *** Nap has joined channel #Twilight_Zone
        *** Topic: The Gernsback Continuum
        *** Users on #Twilight_Zone: Nap msa tober phone @julia @SirLance
          igh @Daemon @Avalon @Waftam @Trillian @tzoper
</code></pre>

<p>The CHANNEL command has the same effects. Note that if no parameters are
given, your current channel is displayed.</p>

<p>Upon entering a channel, you are given useful details about it: list of users
talking in that channel, topic&#8230; Joining a channel does not cause you to
leave your previous channel unless NOVICE is set to ON. See &#8220;/HELP SET
NOVICE&#8221;.</p>

<p>Once in a channel, you may wish to get a detailed list of the people IRCing
inside. That&#8217;s where the WHO command comes in handy:</p>

<p><strong>/WHO</strong>[<channel>|<wildcard expression>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gives a listing of users. &#8220;/WHO *&#8221; for the list of users in your current
  channel.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /WHO #Twilight_Zone

<p>The first field is the current channel, then nickname, status, real name (in
internet user@host form), and a small witty comment you can set yourself with
the environment variable IRCNAME, (this will be detailed in section 2.8).
Status indicates if a user is &#8220;H&#8221;ere or &#8220;G&#8221;one, (see AWAY), if IRCop (&#8220;*&#8221;),
and/or a channel operator (&#8220;@&#8221;).</p>

<p>It is also possible, when you are already on a channel, to ask someone to join
your channel. The command is called INVITE.</p>

<p><strong>/INVITE</strong> <nickname> [<channel>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Invites another user to a channel. If no channel is specified, your current
  channel is used.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /INVITE Nap
        *** Inviting Nap to channel #Twilight_Zone
</code></pre>

<p>If you receive an INVITE message, you can type &#8220;/JOIN -INVITE&#8221; to join the
channel to which you were last invited, or simply &#8220;/JOIN <channel>&#8221;.</p>

<p>To leave a channel, just issue a LEAVE command, (PART has the same effects):</p>

<p><strong>/LEAVE</strong> <channel>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leave a channel.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /LEAVE #Twilight_Zone
        *** Nap has left #Twilight_Zone
</code></pre>

<p>Well, you guessed it, if there is a way to invite someone on a channel,
there&#8217;s also the possibility to KICK someone out of it, for example if this
person is behaving like a jerk, annoying people or flooding the channel with
unwanted information:</p>

<p><strong>/KICK</strong> [<channel>] <nickname>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kicks named user off a given channel. Only &#8216;channel operators&#8217; are
  privileged to use this command.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /KICK #Twilight_Zone Target
        *** Target has been kicked off channel #Twilight_Zone by Nap
</code></pre>

<p>Channels have topics, that indicate the current topic of conversation. You can
change this topic on a channel with the TOPIC command.</p>

<p><strong>/TOPIC</strong> [[<channel>] <topic for channel>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes the topic for the channel.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /TOPIC The silent channel.
        *** Nap has changed the topic on channel #EU-Opers to The silent
          channel.
</code></pre>

<p>At times, you may want to send a description of what you are doing or how you
are feeling or just anything concerning you to the current channel or query.
It is absolutely good style not to forget the period at the end of the
sentence!</p>

<p><strong>/ME</strong> <action description>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tells the current channel or query about what you are doing. You can also
  use your own nickname as command, i.e. you can type the line with a leading
  slash.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /ME opens up the fridge.
        * Nap opens up the fridge.

        /Nap reaches out for the orange juice.
        * Nap reaches out for the orange juice.
</code></pre>

<p>The same goal can be achieved towards a specific nickname using:</p>

<p><strong>/DESCRIBE</strong> <nickname>|<channel> <action description>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sends anything concerning you to the <nickname> or <channel> you pass as
  first argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note: The look of the result depends on each client version, and might not be
exactly the same as in the examples shown here.)</p>

<p>These commands make use of CTCP, a client-to-client protocol crafted to
perform specific actions, but not understood by all clients, (more about CTCP
in section 2.5). If you get an error message, your description may not have
arrived properly.</p>

<h3>2.4 Channel and User Modes</h3>

<p>Channels can have additional constraints, which can be set by the MODE
command, (most of the information in this section can also be obtained by
issuing &#8220;/HELP MODE&#8221;). To understand this, recall that the first person to
JOIN a channel effectively creates it and is initially &#8220;in charge&#8221; of the
channel, (&#8220;Channel Operator&#8221; or &#8220;chanop&#8221;). S/he can subsequently add those
constraints, make other people chanops at leisure.</p>

<pre><code>                         Table 7:  Mode commands
                         -----------------------
                  Keyword  Action
                  ~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~
                  MODE     changes channel or user mode
</code></pre>

<p>Public is the default mode for a channel. When someone is on a public channel,
he can be seen by all other users, (if his own user mode permits this). Anyone
can notice users on a public channel and join such a conversation.</p>

<p>Private means that, although anyone can see members of such a channel, you
can&#8217;t tell what channel they are on unless you are already on that channel
with them. They just appear as &#8220;Prv: *&#8221; in LIST or NAMES. Since the number of
potential channels is in the billions, this is quite some security - all you
give away is the acknowledgement that you&#8217;re IRCing.</p>

<p>If you are on a secret channel, someone who is not on the same channel can&#8217;t
even see that you are there. Your name does not show up in a LIST of active
users. The only indication of your presence is that, when entering IRC, all
new users are told that there are &#8220;NNNNN users on XXX servers&#8221;. If someone
checks on all users and finds less than NNNNN of them, he knows that other
people are hiding on secret channels. But a secret channel user still cannot
be found except by brute-force checking through all channels, a hopeless
proposition in the face of the huge number of possible channel names. Security
through obscurity finally means something.</p>

<p><strong>/MODE</strong> <channel>|<nickname> [[+|-]<modechars> [<parameters>]]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allows channel operators to change channel mode, or any user to change their
  personal mode, (don&#8217;t use this co mmand too often, it floods the net with
  worthless information).</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /MODE #Twilight_Zone +m
        *** Mode change "+m" on channel #Twilight_Zone by Nap

        /MODE Nap -i
        *** Mode change "-i" for user Nap by poly.polytechnique.fr

        And this is how to give 'chanop' status to someone on the channel

        /MODE #Twilight_Zone +o sojge
        *** Mode change "+o sojge" on channel #Twilight_Zone by Nap
</code></pre>

<p>A + or - sign determines whether the mode should be added or deleted. Try
typing &#8220;/HELP MODE&#8221; to get further information. Channels can be moderated
(only chanops can talk), secret, private, with a limited number of users,
anonymous, invite-only, topic-limited, with a list of banned users.</p>

<p>The MODE command also allows you to modify your personal parameters, your
&#8220;user mode&#8221;. You can check your usermode with the command &#8220;/MODE <YourNick>&#8221;
or sometimes &#8220;/UMODE&#8221;. Note that user mode +i may be the default on some
servers, in order to protect privacy of users. This should not be seen as a
problem, since any user can change his/her personal mode whatever defaults a
server may set.</p>

<pre><code>                         Table 8:  Channel modes

<h3>2.5 Client to Client Protocol</h3>

<p><strong>/CTCP</strong> [<argument>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allows you to perform certain client specific actions on the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>        /CTCP Nap VERSION
        *** CTCP VERSION reply from Nap: ircII 2.2 *IX
           :ircII 2.2, SL0 The one you thought you'd never see.

        This can be used to get information about how long a person has
        been idle:

        /CTCP Nap FINGER
        *** CTCP FINGER reply from Nap: PIOCH Nicolas - Nap on IRC, X90,
          (pioch@poly.polytechnique.fr) Idle 0 seconds



                  Table 10:  Client to Client Commands
                  ------------------------------------
         Keyword    Action
         ~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~
         CTCP       performs certain client specific actions
         DCC        handles direct connections to remote clients
         DCC SEND   initiates a file transfer
         DCC GET    accepts a file transfer
         DCC CLOSE  ends a DCC connection or offer
         DCC LIST   shows current DCC connections
         DCC CHAT   initiates a secure chat between two clients
</code></pre>

<p>There are many other CTCP commands, and new ones are introduced all the time.
There is a mechanism for you to find out what you can use: CTCP CLIENTINFO. To
find out about your own client services, execute a CLIENTINFO on yourself.</p>

<pre><code>        /CTCP Nap CLIENTINFO
        *** CTCP CLIENTINFO reply from Nap: SED VERSION CLIENTINFO
           USERINFO ERRMSG FINGER TIME ACTION DCC UTC PING :Use
           CLIENTINFO  to get more specific information
</code></pre>

<p>If you are interested in this powerful CTCP mechanism, have a look in the
various ircII help files. &#8220;/HELP CTCP&#8221; might tell you more. However the
client-to-client protocol has a very powerful feature: Allowing two people to
exchange files.</p>

<p>To send small text files, electronic mail is probably the best solution,
(don&#8217;t rely on the user@host given by the WHOIS command to send mail. However,
ircII provides you a way to establish Direct Client Connections (&#8220;DCC&#8221;) to
perform functions like sending and receiving files.</p>

<p>If NickA wants to send a file to NickB, then NickA should type: &#8220;/DCC SEND
NickB filename&#8221;. On NickB&#8217;s screen will appear: &#8220;*** DCC SEND (filename)
request received from NickA&#8221;. If he, (NickB), wants to get the file, he just
needs to type: &#8220;/DCC GET NickA filename&#8221;</p>

<pre><code>A few seconds later
        *** DCC GET connection with NickA established
        *** DCC GET filename connection to NickA completed
will   inform  both  users  that  data  transfer  has  been  successfully
completed.
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick overview of the subject:</p>

<p><strong>/DCC</strong> <function> [<arguments>] </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Handles direct connections to remote clients. The behaviour of DCC is
  determined by the specified .</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>/DCC SEND</strong> <nickname> <filename>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initiates a file transfer by direct client connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>/DCC GET</strong> <nickname> <filename>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accepts a file transfer by direct client connection. The sender must first
  have offered the file with DCC SEND.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>/DCC CLOSE</strong> <type> <nickname> [<arguments>]  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ends an unwanted DCC connection or offer. The , <nickname> and <arguments>
  must be the same as those shown by &#8220;/DCC LIST&#8221;. If the arguments are not
  supplied, the oldest connection of the specified type is closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>/DCC LIST</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shows current /DCC connections with their types, status and nicknames
  involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More details can be found in ircII online help: try &#8220;/HELP DCC&#8221; for more
information.</p>

<p>If someone asks you to send him a file, don&#8217;t do it unless you exactly know
what you are doing. For instance, NEVER send the password file of your system
to anybody. This could grant crackers illegal access to your machines, and put
you and your system administrator in a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>DCC also allows two clients to establish a direct client connection for chat.
This is a secure form of communication, since messages are not sent through
the IRC network.</p>

<p><strong>/DCC CHAT</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initiates a direct client connection chat to the given nick, who must repond
  with DCC CHAT. Once established, messages are sent over with &#8220;/MSG =Nickname
  &#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<h3>2.6 Network Related Commands</h3>

<p>If you encounter any problem, contact your local IRC-Administrator or an IRC-
Operator. An IRC-Admin is a person who has access to all files concerning
&#8216;ircd&#8217; (the server program). An IRC-Operator or &#8220;IRC-op&#8221; is a person who has
privileges given to him by an IRC-Admin and tries to maintain a fast reliable
IRC network. Information on how you can find out who s/he is, can be found
below.</p>

<p>Each time you are prompted for a server name, remember you can supply the
nickname of someone being connected on that server instead. This may be useful
at times.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the IRC network can send out
the information that you have left your previous server. So don&#8217;t be surprised

it with /NICK again.</p>

<h3>2.8 Further into ircII Wizardry</h3>

<p>Note: This part should be reserved for experienced IRC&#8217;ers.</p>

<p>Because ircII is not a simple client program, but an Operating System, its
programming language is just as simple as you could expect (it&#8217;s horrendous),
but if you want to get into it, here&#8217;s a little note for you.</p>

<p>There are a few Unix environment variables you can set in your shell
configuration file, but you need to find out your shell name before that.
&#8220;echo $SHELL&#8221; should give you a hint.</p>

<pre><code>                Table 12:  Setting environment variables
                ----------------------------------------
   Shell type      Shell name      Command
   ~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~
   Bourne shells   sh              $ VARNAME="value" ; export VARNAME
                   ksh             $ export VARNAME="value"
                   bash            $ export VARNAME="value"
   C-shells        csh             % setenv VARNAME "value"
                   tcsh            &gt; setenv VARNAME "value"




                    Table 13:  Environment variables
                    --------------------------------
      Name            Effects
      ~~~~            ~~~~~~~
      HOME            where your home directory is
      IRCNAME         any lunacy you want instead of your real name
                      (text that appears between parentheses in a WHOIS)
      IRCNICK         your default IRC nickname
      IRCPATH         a directory path to LOAD scripts
      IRCRC           a file to use instead of your $HOME/.ircrc
      IRCSERVER       a default server list for ircII
      TERM            your terminal type
</code></pre>

<p>The command character, (usually &#8220;/irchelp/&#8221;), is only necessary when you type
commands interactively. When you program things it is no longer needed
although it used to be.</p>

<pre><code>                       Table 14: Advanced commands
                       ---------------------------
    Keyword         Action
    ~~~~~~~         ~~~~~~
    #               same as COMMENT except for the lenght
    @               performs variable expressions
    ALIAS           creates command aliases
    ASSIGN          creates user variables (expandable with $)
    BIND            binds a keystroke sequence to a function

    CD              changes ircII working directory
    COMMENT         does nothing, but very useful. Strange, uh?
    ECHO            displays all of its arguments
    EXEC            allows you to start subprocesses
    FLUSH           flushes all pending output from the server

    IF              standard boolean expression checker
    LOAD            loads an ircII command script file
    ON              sets up actions to occur when certain events happen
    REDIRECT        forwards the output from a command
    SAVE            saves all ircII settings into a file

    SAY             same as sending text to a channel
    SEND            same as sending text to a channel
    SET             sets a variable to a given value
    SLEEP           suspends ircII for a few seconds
    TYPE            simulates keystrokes

    WAIT            waits for all server output to finish
    WHILE           another control command to make loops
    WINDOW          lets you manipulate multiple "windows" in ircII
    XECHO           like ECHO, but takes flag arguments
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to type to the channel from within an ALIAS or on BINDing, you
have to use SAY or SEND.</p>

<p>The &#8220;;&#8221; has a special meaning in ALIASes, BINDings and ONs: it&#8217;s treated as
command separator, that means you can execute multiple commands in a row
separated by semicolons. The semicolons are not considered separators when you
use them interactively, (to be able to type &#8220;;-)&#8221;), and within an ircII script
file. You can escape the meaning of &#8220;;&#8221; in an ALIAS with &#8220;\;&#8221;.</p>

<p>When you use ircII on a (semi)regular basis, you will discover that every time
you start the program you will issue the same initialization sequence. If that
is the case, I have good news for you: you don&#8217;t have to do that anymore!
ircII will, at startup, load a file called &#8220;.ircrc&#8221;, (full path:
$HOME/.ircrc). It will treat each line in that file as if you typed it
manually.</p>

<p>For example, if the content of your .ircrc file is:</p>

<pre><code>        JOIN #Twilight_Zone
</code></pre>

<p>then each time you will start IRC, you will join this channel.</p>

<p>Advanced commands may come in handy if you need them. Feel free to browse in
ircII online help to find out more about them. A few of them are probably
worth learning.</p>

<h3>2.10 Writing automatons</h3>

<p>An automaton, (also called robot or service), is a program that is connected
to the IRC network to provide services. Many people try to set that up with a
few ircII commands like:</p>

<pre><code>        on ^msg "% help" notice $0 This is LameBot 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>However, you should know that setting up an automaton using ircII ON
facilities is quick and dirty, and should be reserved for robots that rely on
ircII specific features such as DCC (file servers for instance). Writing a
program in C, perl or any decent programming language should take longer in
the beginning, but your efforts will be rewarded. You can download skeletons
of such programs on some ftp sites that keep IRC related stuff (check in the
Frequently Asked Questions part).</p>

<p>Although most robots-writers believe they have created a &#8220;smart thing&#8221;, 99% of
the robots online happen to be a nuisance to the IRC community, because a few
simple rules were not respected by their owners. The main idea is that robots
should neither be seen nor heard:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>automatons should be clearly identified as such, having &#8220;bot&#8221;,&#8221;serv&#8221; or &#8220;srv&#8221; in their nickname.</p></li>
<li><p>they should use NOTICES to communicate with the rest of the world, and not reply to NOTICES they get.</p></li>
<li><p>they should be able to always be killed (craziness is a frequent disease among robots).</p></li>
<li><p>they should be able to be killed remotely by their owner via IRC.</p></li>
<li><p>they should not give access to their owner&#8217;s real files, (bandits have already been able to crack people&#8217;s accounts through their robots).</p></li>
<li><p>they should not send messages to channels (unless the channel is dedicated to that robot).</p></li>
<li><p>they should not flood channels with MODE changes. Basically, if you have such a command as:  </p>

<pre><code>    on -JOIN "Lamer #BotTub" mode #BotTub +o Lamer
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>then you are wrong. Because this is what you will get:</p>

<pre><code>*** Lamer (clueless@where.the.hell) has joined channel #bottub
*** Mode change "+o Lamer" on channel #bottub by LameBot
*** Mode change "+o Lamer" on channel #bottub by StupidSrv
*** Mode change "+ooo Lamer Lamer Lamer" on channel #bottub by FloodServ
*** Mode change "+o Lamer" on channel #bottub by Dumbbot
</code></pre>

<p>And this will get boring very soon, so don&#8217;t be surprised if such robots get
banned from most channels. A good kludge is to wait until someone asks
explicitly the robot to be opped on a channel. This could be:</p>

<pre><code>      on -MSG "Lamer op me on #BotTub" mode #BotTub +o Lamer
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t respect rules 2 and 6 above, this may happen too:</p>

<pre><code>*** TalkBot (clueless@where.the.hell) has joined channel #bottub
&lt;LameBot&gt; Hi TalkBot!
&lt;TalkBot&gt; Hello LameBot! How are you?
*** Mode change "+o TalkBot" on channel #bottub by LameBot
&lt;LameBot&gt; Fine thanx.
&lt;TalkBot&gt; Thank you for the op, LameBot.
&lt;LameBot&gt; No problem, TalkBot.
*** Signoff: Talkbot (ircserver.irc.edu where.the.hell)
*** TalkBot (clueless@where.the.hell) has joined channel #bottub
*** Mode change "+o TalkBot" on channel #bottub by where.the.hell
*** Mode change "+o LameBot" on channel #bottub by TalkBot
*** Mode change "+o TalkBot" on channel #bottub by LameBot
&lt;TalkBot&gt; Thank you for the op, LameBot.
&lt;LameBot&gt; No problem, TalkBot.
...
</code></pre>

<p>See? Remember the golden rule:</p>

<p>**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A smart bot won&#8217;t act unless explicitly asked by someone to.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>For Unix machines, you either compile the source yourself, or have someone
else on your machine compile the source for you. The current &#8220;official&#8221; ircII
release is version 2.2.1. That means that it is said to be quite bugfree
(Hehe, you never know&#8230;) In addition to this &#8220;official&#8221; distribution, you may
find preversions of the client to come floating around, for people who like to
track down bugs and taste things to come. However, you should be aware of that
those clients are being worked on, and may not have all features working
properly.</p>

<p>Here are the commands to type to setup an ircII client:</p>

<pre><code>        ~ &gt; ftp
        ftp&gt; verbose off
        Verbose mode off.
        ftp&gt; open cs.bu.edu
        Name (cs.bu.edu:yourname) : ftp
        Password: yourname@yourhost
        ftp&gt; cd irc/clients
        ftp&gt; bin
        ftp&gt; get ircII2.2.1.2.tar.Z "|zcat|tar xf -"
        ftp&gt; get ircII2.2.1help.tar.Z "|zcat|tar xf -"
        ftp&gt; quit
        ~ &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You now have to go into ircII2.2.1 and read the files explaining how to
achieve a successful installation. Have a look at README and INSTALL, edit
config.h to define DEFAULT<em>SERVER, edit Makefile to define INSTALL</em>EXECUTABLE,
IRCII_LIBRARY and the C compiler you will be using, then type make install and
wait.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t set up a client on any local machine, you can still use any
telnet client:</p>

<pre><code>                     Table 16:  Open telnet clients
                     ------------------------------
      Area      Command                                 login name
      ~~~~      ~~~~~~~                                 ~~~~~~~~~~
      America   telnet bradenville.andrew.cmu.edu
                telnet chatsubo.nersc.gov               bbs

      Asia      telnet cc.nsysu.edu.tw                  irc

      Europe    telnet ircclient.itc.univie.ac.at 6668
                telnet irc.ibmpcug.co.uk 9999
</code></pre>

<p>Please only use telnet when you have no other way of reaching IRC, as this
resource is quite limited.</p>

<h3>3.2 Which server do I connect to?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s usually best to try and connect to one geographically close, even though
that may not be the best. You can always ask when you get on IRC. Here&#8217;s a
list of servers available for connection:</p>

<pre><code>                       Table 17:  Open IRC servers
                       ---------------------------
              America   Canada        ug.cs.dal.ca
              ~~~~~~~   USA           csa.bu.edu
                                      ucsu.coloradu.edu
                                      irc.caltech.edu

              Europe    Finland       nic.funet.fi
              ~~~~~~    France        poly.polytechnique.fr
                        Germany       noc.belwue.de
                        Sweden        irc.nada.kth.se

              Oceania   Australia     munagin.ee.mu.oz.au
              ~~~~~~~
</code></pre>

<p>This is by no means, a comprehensive list, but merely a start. Connect to the
closest of these servers and join the channel #Twilight_Zone or, if you are in
Europe, #EU-Opers. When you are there, immediately ask what you want. Don&#8217;t
say &#8220;I have a question&#8221; because then everyone will ignore you until you say it
a few times, and then they&#8217;ll jump down your throat and rip your lungs out. No
one knows if he can answer your question until you ask it.</p>

<h1>riskybus is a non-stop quiz show similar to Jeopardy. Just join the fun and</h1>

<p>find out! (German users may try channels named after German university
towns&#8230;)</p>

<p>Many IRC Operators are in #Twilight_Zone, while European Operators congregate
in #EU-Opers. So if you join an Operator channel and don&#8217;t hear much talking,
don&#8217;t worry; it&#8217;s not because you joined. Operators don&#8217;t talk much on such
channels anyways!</p>

<h3>3.4 How do I get nifty effects with ircII?</h3>

<p>You can highlight messages you send using control chars: parts of text
surrounded by control-b (^B) will appear in video reverse to most ircII users
for instance. However the appearance of such effects relies on the terminal
abilities of the user you&#8217;re writing to.</p>

<p>In some cases keys are already bound to something. For instance, ^B is
normally bound to BACKWARD<em>CHARACTER, so you will need to define a &#8220;quote-
character&#8221; key: just enter &#8220;/BIND ^W QUOTE</em>CHARACTER&#8221; then &#8220;/BIND ^W^B
SELF_INSERT&#8221; and it may work.</p>

<pre><code>                  Table 18:  Highlighting ircII output
                  ------------------------------------
                           Key  Effect
                           ~~~  ~~~~~~
                           ^V   Video reverse
                           ^_   Underline
                           ^B   Bold
</code></pre>

<h3>3.5 What if someone tells me to type something cryptic?</h3>

<p>NEVERtype anything anyone tells you to without knowing what it is. There is a
problem with typing a certain command with the ircII client that gives anyone
immediate control of your client, (and thus can alter your account environment
also). Look in the ircII on-line help each time you can.</p>

<h3>3.6 I get strange characters on my screen, what are they?</h3>

<p>IRC has quite a few people from Scandinavian countries, }{|][\ are letters in
their alphabet (IRC is supposed to support the ISO Latin-1 8-bit character
set, but your client must be able to display them.) This has been explained on
IRC about a thousand and one times, so read the following, do not ask it on
IRC:</p>

<pre><code>           Table 19:  Nordic countries character translations
           --------------------------------------------------
    Character  Description
    ~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~
    [, {       'a' with two dots over it
    ], }       'a' with a small circle above it
    \, |       'o' with two dots over it, or a dash ("/irchelp/") through it
               ("[", "]", and "\" = upper case)
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to that, Japanese IRC&#8217;ers use a special ANSI escape control
sequences to transmit their Kanji alphabet. This may also look funny if you
get some of it. Here&#8217;s a sample: [$B$?$K$7[$B;$m$K# (nice, uh?)</p>

<h3>3.7 What about NickServ?</h3>

<p>To quote from NickServ&#8217;s help text, NickServ&#8217;s purpose is to help avoiding
nickname confusions on IRC. There&#8217;s no such thing as &#8220;nickname ownership&#8221;,
however NickServ sends a warning to anyone else who signs on with your
nickname. If you don&#8217;t use IRC for 10 weeks, your nickname registration
expires for reuse.</p>

<p>Only a NickServ operator can change your NickServ password. To find out which
NickServ operators are on-line, send:</p>

<pre><code>        /MSG NickServ@Service.de OPERWHO
</code></pre>

<p>Nicknames with a &#8220;*&#8221; next to them are online at the time.</p>

<p>Note: As of this writing, NickServ is down and it is uncertain when or if it
will return.</p>

<h3>3.8 I&#8217;m being flooded or harassed by a jerk. HELP!</h3>

<p>If somebody is behaving like a jerk on IRC, like dumping to a channel Mb&#8217;s of
garbage, then he should be KICKed and eventually banned from the channel, (see
&#8220;/HELP MODE&#8221; for details).</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s a matter of personal harassment, then you should set a proper IGNOREon
that person, (preferably on his userid@hostname). Remember you can use
wildcard expressions for IGNORE.</p>

<h3>3.9 How do I get rid of a ghosted IRC session?</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may have a &#8220;ghosted&#8221; IRC session, a process still running on
your machine you would like to get rid of, but can&#8217;t control anymore to issue
a QUIT command. Going back to a unix shell, try listing your processes: (&#8220;ps
-ux&#8221; or &#8220;ps -f&#8221; depending on your system)</p>

<pre><code>    poly ~ &gt; ps -ux
    USER       PID  %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS TT STAT TIME COMMAND
    pioch    10410   1.4  0.2  839  402 pf S    0:00 /usr/local/bin/emacs
    pioch    25441   0.6  0.9 2888 1908 ?  S    0:32 xterm -ls
    pioch    25444   0.4  0.2  550  341 pf S    0:17 -tcsh (tcsh)
    pioch    10404   0.1  0.3  897  624 pf S    0:00 irisVx 5 4 10403
    pioch    25634   0.0  0.3 1022  678 p6 S    0:22 irc
    pioch    25451   0.0  0.2  953  326 ?  S    0:07 xmailbox
    pioch    25452   0.0  0.1  386  147 ?  S    0:00 xdaliclock
    pioch    25459   0.0  0.3 1109  617 ?  S    0:02 xman
    pioch    10403   0.0  0.1  574  124 pf I    0:00 mapleV
    pioch    10423   0.0  0.2  614  459 pf R    0:00 /bin/ps -ux
</code></pre>

<p>Locate the line about your lost IRC session, (irc should appear in the COMMAND
field of the line), and its PID, (process number, second field of the line
here). In this example the PID is 25634, as shown here:</p>

<pre><code>    USER       PID  %CPU %MEM   SZ  RSS TT STAT TIME COMMAND
    pioch    25634   0.0  0.3 1022  678 p6 S    0:22 irc
</code></pre>

<p>All you then need to type is &#8220;kill -KILL&#8221; or &#8220;kill -9&#8221; immediatly followed by
the PID found above: &#8220;kill -kill 25634&#8221; here.</p>

<p>You can get more details about the commands involved here in the standard unix
manual, (&#8220;man 1 ps&#8221; or &#8220;man 1 kill&#8221;).</p>

<p>If your machine crashed, and your nick is still in use on the IRC network,
you&#8217;ll have to wait 4 to 5 minutes for your server to recognize the fact.
Getting an Operator to kill the ghost is almost never necessary, just sign on
as another nickname and wait for the &#8220;Ping timeout&#8221; or &#8220;Bad link&#8221; message,
then you can change your nick back.</p>

<h3>3.10 About KILL usage</h3>

<p>KILL is a command restricted to IRC-Operators to deal with protocol errors
heavily reducing the IRC network functionality. It&#8217;s to be used with extreme
caution, if at all.</p>

<p>**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>KILL should never interfere with channel-operator status.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**</p>

<p>If you op someone on a channel, you take the consequences. If someone joins</p>

<h1>Whatever, you op them, then they kick everyone and lock the channel with some</h1>

<p>&#8220;Mode change +ib <em>!</em>@*&#8221;, then suffer it: it&#8217;s your fault, don&#8217;t go whining to
an IRC-op to fix it. If a channel is locked, you should start a new one.</p>

<p>Effective methods to deal with obnoxious people are IGNORE, KICK and various
MODEs on channels, such as +i and/or +b.</p>

<p>If you have been unjustifiably killed by an IRC-Operator abusing his power to
gain illegal channel-operator status for instance, yell! Mail a log to his
server IRC-Administrator, (see ADMIN), join #Twilight_Zone or #EU-Opers for
European-related problems, and explain what happened.</p>

<h3>3.11 Where can I find more?</h3>

<p>Should your question not be listed above, you may want to check the
&#8220;Frequently Unasked Questions&#8221;, (FUQ) list, which will be shipping real soon
now, featuring replies to:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;lamer1&gt;&gt; Are there any good FTP sites? (1)
        &lt;lamer2&gt; How do I join a channel?
        &lt;lamer3&gt; How do I become an IRCop?
</code></pre>

<p>If you have access to Usenet News, (usually through a program called rn, trn,
xrn or nn), you may want to join alt.irc debates, flamings and whinings.</p>

<p>You can also join various IRC related mailing lists. &#8220;Operlist&#8221; discusses
current (and past) server code, routing and protocol. Mail operlist-
request@eff.org to join. Another mailing list, ircd-three@eff.org exists to
discuss protocol revisions for the 3.0 release of ircd, currently in planning.
Mail ircd-three-request@eff.org to be added to that. There is also low-traffic
mailing-lists for ircII vmsirc and irchat clients.</p>

<h1>4. ADMINISTRATIVIA</h1>

<h3>4.1 Revision history</h3>

<p>This is version 1.1 of this paper. Version 1.0 of the IRCprimer was released
in postscript form in June 1992 because I was sick of people asking for an IRC
or ircII manual (and it was a good way to learn LaTeX!). During summer 1992
Owe Rasmussen did a very nice text conversion of the paper. Due to the support
and many remarks I got, a new version is finally completed (special thanks to
Olaf Titz !), along with Owe&#8217;s plain ascii conversion.</p>

<p>The primer is available in 3 formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>IRCprimer.ps.Z: Postscript version </li>
<li>IRCprimer.txt: Plain text version </li>
<li>IRCprimer.tex.Z: Source code. </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>4.2 Release sites for the IRCprimer</h3>

<p>The latest version of the primer can be found on the following ftp sites,
thanks to their admins:</p>

<pre><code>                    Table 21: IRCprimer release sites

        ftp&gt; verbose off
        Verbose mode off.
        ftp&gt; open cs.bu.edu
        Name (cs.bu.edu:yourname): ftp
        Password: yourname@yourhost
        ftp&gt; cd irc/support
        ftp&gt; bin
        ftp&gt; get IRCprimer.ps.Z
        ftp&gt; quit
        ~ &gt; uncompress IRCprimer.ps.Z
